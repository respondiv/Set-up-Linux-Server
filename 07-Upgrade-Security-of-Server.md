#### Set-Up UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)

**Install Firewall if it's not already installed**

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ufw
```

**Set Deny as the default rule (this blocks everything)**

`sudo ufw default deny`

**Allow SSH with new port 22233 [update ssh port prior to this](https://github.com/respondiv/Set-up-Linux-Server/blob/master/6-Add-Edit-Users.md#change-the-ssh-port-for-security)**

`sudo ufw allow 22233/tcp`

**Allow HTTP**

`sudo ufw allow 80/tcp`

**Allow HTTPS**

`sudo ufw allow 443/tcp`

**Allow MySQL**

`sudo ufw allow 3306/tcp`

**Allow web admin access port for EasyEngine, default 22222 [update port](https://github.com/respondiv/Set-up-Linux-Server/blob/master/3-Install-Easy-Engine.md#lets-secure-easyengine-while-we-are-at-it)**

`sudo ufw allow 33344/tcp`

**Enable the firewall**

`sudo ufw enable`

**Check firewall status**

`sudo ufw status verbose`

#### Secure Shared Memory

To prevent shared memory being used against a service attack, update `/etc/fstab` with following

```
# Open file in File Editor
sudo nano /etc/fstab

#Add this line to the end of file
tmpfs /dev/shm tmpfs defaults,noexec,nosuid 0 0
```

Press `ctrl+x` and type `y` to save and exit

#### Network Hardening & Optimizing

We need to edit `/etc/sysctl.conf` in order to prevent incorrect packet routing and malformed IPâ€™s.

`sudo nano /etc/sysctl.conf`

Add following lines at the end of file

```
# Add/Edit the following lines to the file

# IP Spoofing protection
net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter = 1
net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter = 1
 
# Ignore ICMP broadcast requests
net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts = 1
 
# Disable source packet routing
net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_source_route = 0
net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_source_route = 0
net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_source_route = 0
net.ipv6.conf.default.accept_source_route = 0
 
# Ignore send redirects
net.ipv4.conf.all.send_redirects = 0
net.ipv4.conf.default.send_redirects = 0
 
# Block SYN attacks
net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies = 1
net.ipv4.tcp_max_syn_backlog = 2048
net.ipv4.tcp_synack_retries = 2
net.ipv4.tcp_syn_retries = 5
 
# Log Martians
net.ipv4.conf.all.log_martians = 1
net.ipv4.icmp_ignore_bogus_error_responses = 1
 
# Ignore ICMP redirects
net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_redirects = 0
net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_redirects = 0
net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_redirects = 0
net.ipv6.conf.default.accept_redirects = 0
 
# Ignore Directed pings
net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_all = 1

```

Press `ctrl+x` and type `y` to save and exit

**Reload sysctl**

`sudo sysctl -p`

#### Prevent IP Spoofing

Edit the hosts config

`sudo nano /etc/host.conf`

Add / Edit following lines

```
# only add this if its not present
order bind,hosts

# add this at the end of file
nospoof on
```

#### Ban Hosts - Using Fail2Ban

**Install Fail2Ban**

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install fail2ban
```

**Install sendmail to get notification and install iptables-persistent to allow the server to automatically setup our firewall rules at boot**

`sudo apt-get install sendmail iptables-persistent`

**To Edit Faile2Ban config, copy the config file (jail.conf) to jail.local to prevent it from modifying when upgrading**

`sudo cp /etc/fail2ban/jail.conf /etc/fail2ban/jail.local`

Establish a base firewall. With ufw setup no need for this, but you can view these settings on : [https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-fail2ban-on-ubuntu-14-04](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-fail2ban-on-ubuntu-14-04)

**Edit Fail2Ban conf file**

`sudo nano /etc/fail2ban/jail.local`

**Add / Edit the necessary config and Enable needed services**

ignoreregex =
```

Press `ctrl+x` and type `y` to save and exit

# Scan access log for HTTP 200 + POST /sessions => failed log in

[INCLUDES]

# Read common prefixes. If any customizations available -- read them from common.local

before = common.conf
[Definition]
failregex = ^<HOST> -.*POST /sessions HTTP/1\.." 200
ignoreregex =
```

Press `ctrl+x` and type `y` to save and exit

**Filter for Blocking IPs trying to execute scripts such as .php, .pl, .exe and other funny scripts**

`sudo nano nginx-noscript.conf`

Copy paste following

```

failregex = ^<HOST> -.*GET http.*
ignoreregex =
```

Press `ctrl+x` and type `y` to save and exit

**Shutdown Fail2Ban service**

`sudo service fail2ban stop`

**Start the service**

`sudo service fail2ban start`

**Check status**

```
# displays all status
sudo fail2ban-client status

# for each jail status, e.g SSH
sudo fail2ban-client status ssh
```

**Unban single ip, get jail name from above status command**

```
# Syntax: fail2ban-client get jail-name actionunban ipaddress
fail2ban-client get ssh actionunban 1.2.3.4
```

#### Reboot is required

`sudo reboot now`
